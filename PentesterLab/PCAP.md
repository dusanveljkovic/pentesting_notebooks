## 01
Wireshark is used to analyize PCAP files which contains connection data captured on a network.
## 02
Telenet data is not encrypted and any information sent with it is visible to anyone. Wwe can easily extract the login information for the telnet connection.
## 03
FTP connections without TLS are insecure as aynone can see the traffic and access the username and password used.
## 04
Passive retrival of FTP file happens in two stages:
* The client authenticates and tells the server what file it wants to retrieve followed by the PASV command. The server will send back an IP address and port to the server
* The client connects to that IP and port to retrieve the file
File is then sent and we can see it.
## 06
RSH trust is performed by creating <b>.rhost</b> file on the server with the IP of the client. The packets sent between the two have no encryption.
## 07
Rlogin connection is also insecure because the credentials are transmitted in cleartext.
## 08
SMTP is a protocol used to send mail. Credentials are sent in cleartext just encoded in base64 which is trivial to decode.
## 09
## 10
SMTP attachments are transmitted encoded in uuencoding which can be easily deocde with `uudecode` command.
## 11
POP3 is an mail protocol used to retrieve mail from a remote server to a local email client.
Its credentials are also sent by cleartext.
## 12
IMAP protocol has the same functionality as POP3 but mail can also be sent using it unlike POP3.
## 14
HTTP headedr <b>Content-Length</b> contains the actual size of the body. This information is used to know how much data it should read from the TCP socket.
## 15
Cookies are also sent with HTTP requests.
## 18
Authorization header is used to authorize a user. When the Autogiraztion Basic method is used username and password are concatenated using a : and base64 encoded.
## 19
Authorization can also be provided using <b>Bearer</b> token. Token is using JWT format. It is encoded like `header.payload.signature`. Each part is base64 encoded JSON string.
## 21
When we have a `zlib compressed` data we can add a magic number in front of it `\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00` to make gzip want to unzip it.
## 22
When chunk encoding is used server can send content wwithout waiting for the full response to be ready.
## 24
DNS is used to translate ip address to hostname
DNS <b>A</b> record contains information about ip address and the matching hostname.
## 25
DNS query can happen by both <b>TCP & UDP</b>
## 26
DNS <b>TXT</b> record is used to store human readable text.
## 27
Transaction ID is used to authenticate a server reponse. Client generates it and sends it along with the DNS query to the server. Server responds and sends back the transaction ID. Problem arrises when this transaction ID is predictable so an attacker can impersonate a DNS server.
## 29
ICMP is often used to send ping requests. However one can embedd a message in a request and send it without raising any alarms.
## 30
In a TLS connection a client is getting a certificate as a part of the <b>Server Hello</b>. In that response we can find a lot of information about the server.
## 31
The client can use a TLS extension name <b>Server Name Indication</b> as a part of the <b>Client Hello</b> to indicate what certificate it wants from the server.
## 32
We can use a servers private key to decode TLS traffic.
## 33
When Forward Secrecy is used in a TLS protocol we can't decrypt it using only the private key.
