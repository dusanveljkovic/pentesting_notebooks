## Unix 03
It is useful to know what command the user has ran in the past. Command history for bash is stored in a hidden file <b>.bash_history</b>.
## Unix 05
The <b>.bashrc</b> file is loaded when a user stars a new shell. It is used to define aliases for commands or to save some variables.
You can supply and `-exec` argument to the `find` command to make it execute a program on every found file. It uses Linux exec directly, so our shell is not executing the command. That means any shell expansion wont work because we dont have a shell.
After the `-exec` we need to provide a results placeholder `{}` and the delimiter `\;` which lets `find` know where the command end.
## Unix 07
Users can use other shells like `sh`, `zsh`, `ksh`. Eash of them have their own history and rc files.
## Unix 08
Service accounts often don't have their home directory in `/home`. 
You can find the location of the home directory of each user by inspecting `/etc/passwd` file.
## Unix 09
One common mistake is: people typing their password in their shell instead of the password prompt. By doing this their password will be available in their history files.
## Unix 10
There are often files left in the `/tmp` directory. These files are accessible to eveyone so it is often worth checking them.
## Unix 11
There are also ofthen files left in `/var/tmp` directory. The difference between this directory and `/tmp` is that this directory is not removed upon system reboot.
## Unix 12
File type can by acquired by runing `file [FILE_NAME]`.
## Unix 13
To run jobs on regular basis system administrators use <b>cron</b>. It is useful to look what jobs are being run with cron.
## Unix 14
You can become another user with the `su [USER_NAME]` command.
## Unix 15
For cracking passwords we can use <b>john-the-ripper</b> tool.
`john [FILE] --format=[FORMAT]`
File must be formatted like username:hash.
## Unix 16
Hashes starting:
* MD5 -> `$1$`
* Blowfish -> `$2$` or `$2a`
* SHA-256 -> `$5$`
* SHA-512 -> `$6$`
## Unix 17
Tomcat info about users is stored in a xml file named `tomcat-users.xml`. 
This file can often be found either in a directory where tomcat is installed or in a directory starting with `tomcat` in `/etc/`
## Unix 18
Mysql is a common database service running on a Linux system. On a lot of systems you can connect to it with `root` username and no password.
## Unix 20
There is a `user.MYD` file which is only acessible to mysql user. When mysql user has a shell we can log in as him and read the file. In that file there are passwords for all accounts used in mysql instance. We can crack the passwords using `john` by using `--format=mysql-sha1`
## Unix 22
In a PostgreSQL database navigation is a little different.
* `\list` to list databases
* `\c [DATABASE]` to select a database
* `\d` to list the tables
## Unix 23
Sql copy command can be used to read files from the target system. 
```sql
CREATE TABLE demo(t text);
COPY demo from '[FILENAME]';
SELECT * FROM demo;
```
## Unix 24
SQLite3 database can be accessed with a simple `sqlite3 [FILENAME]` command.
## Unix 25
By running `sudo -l` we can get the information about what programs we can run as another user.
Then by using `sudo -u [OTHER_USER] [COMMAND]` we can run that command as that user.
## Unix 26
We can escalate our privileges by executing `find . -exec /bin/bash \;` as another user.
## Unix 27
We can also escalate our privileges by using `vim`. When in `vim` we can execute `!/bin/bash` to get the shell.
## Unix 28 
We can run commands from a `less` instance by using `![COMMAND]`.
## Unix 29
Awk privilege escalation is performed by using `awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/bash")}'`
## Unix 30
Setuid and setgid are used to make a program run as the owner even if it is started by another user.
We can exploit this by copying a malicious file as a user which makes it owned by that user. By setting the setuid bit with `chmod +xs [FILE]` we can make it run as that user.
## Unix 31
We can run `perl` script with `perl -e '[COMMANDS]'`.
## Unix 33
We can get a ruby interactive shell by using 
```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e 'require "irb" ; IRB.start(__FILE__)'
```
Once the REPL is running we can run commands by using backticks.
## Unix 34
We can privilege escalate using `node -e` with following code.
```node
var exec = require('child_process').exec;  
exec('[COMMAND]', function (error, stdOut, stdErr) {  
console.log(stdOut);  
});
```
