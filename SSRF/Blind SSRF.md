## How to find and exploit blinf SSRF vulnerabilites
The most reliable way to detect blind SSRF vulnerabilites is using out-of-band techniques.

Simply identifying a blind [[SSRF]] vulnerability that can trigger out-of-band HTTP request doesn't in itself provide a route to exploitability. However, it can still be leveraged to probe for other vulnerabilites on the server itself or on other back-end system. You can blindly sweep the internal IP address space sending payloads designed to detect well-known vulnerabilites.

Another venue for exploiting blind [[SSRF]] vulnerabilites is to induce the application to connect to a system under the attacker's control and return malicious responses to the [[HTTP]] client that makes the connection.
