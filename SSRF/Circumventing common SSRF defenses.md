## SSRF with blacklist-based input filters
Some applications block input containing hostnames like `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`, or sensitive URLs like `/admin`. We can circumvent this filter by:
* Using an alternative IP representation of `127.0.0.1` such as `2130706433`, `017700000001` or `127.1.`
* Registering your own domain name that resolves to `127.0.0.1`. You can use `spoofed.burpcollaborator.net` for this purpose
* Obfuscating blocked string using URL encoding or case variation

## SSRF with whitelist-based input filters
Some application only allow input that matches, begins with, or contains, a whitelist of permitted values. In this situation, you can sometimes circumvent the filter by exploiting inconsistencies in URL parsing.
* You can embed credentials in a URL before the hostname, using `@`
`https://expected-host@evil-host`
* You can use `#` to indicate a URL fragment
`https://evil-host#expected-host`
* You can leverage the [[Domain Name System]] naming hierarchy to place required input into a fully-qualified DNS name that you control
`https://expected-host.evil-host`
* You can URL-encode characters to confuse the URL-parsing code
* You can use combinations of these techniques together

## Bypassing SSRF filters via open redirect
It is sometiems possible to circumvent any kind of filter-based defenses by exploiting an open redirection vulnerability.
