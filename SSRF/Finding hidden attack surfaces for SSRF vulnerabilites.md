## Partial URLs in requests
Sometimes an application places only a hostname or part of a URL path into request parameters. The value submitted is then incorporated server-side into a full URL that is requested.

## URLs within data formats
Some applications transmit data in formats whose specification allows the inclusion of URLs that might get requested by the data parser for the format. For example when an application accepts data in XML format and parses it, it might be vulnerable to [[XXE injection]], and it turn be vulnerable to [[SSRF]].

## SSRF via the Referer header
Some application employ server-side analytics software that ttracks visitors. The software often logs the Referer header in requests sine this is of particular interest for tracking incoming links. Often the analytics software will actually visit any third-party URL that appears in the Referer header.
