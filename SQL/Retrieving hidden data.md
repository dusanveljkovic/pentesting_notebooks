## Example
Consider an SQL statement:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
```
This statement returns all product from a given category which are released.
If an attacker can controll the category field he can input an `'` which terminates the string, than by inputing an [[SQL#Comments]] he can terminate the rest of the query making the check for released obsolete.
New query would like like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM product WHERE category = '' --' AND released = 1
```
This query would give an attacker all the product no matter if they are released or not.
