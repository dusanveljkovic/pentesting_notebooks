## What is SQL injection ?
[[SQL]] injection is a web security vulnerability that allow an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database.
## SQL injection examples
* [[Retrieving hidden data]] - attacker can modify an SQL query to return additional values
* [[Subverting application logic]] - attacker can change a query to interfere with the application's logic
* [[UNION attacks]] - attacker can retrieve data from different database tables
* [[Examining the database]] - attacker can extract information about the version and the structure of the database
* [[Blind SQL injection]] - where the results of a query are not return in the application's responses

## How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilites
* Submitting the single quote character `'` and looking for errors or other anomalies
* Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systemic differences in the resulting response
* Submitting Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and looking for differences in response
* Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond
* Submitting OAST payloads designed to trigger out-of-band network interaction when executed within an SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions

## SQL injection in different parts of the query
Most SQL injections vulnerabilites arise within the [[SQL#WHERE]] clause of the [[SQL#SELECT]] query.
But SQL injections can happen at other locations like:
* In [[SQL#UPDATE]] statements, within the updated values or the [[SQL#WHERE]] clause
* In [[SQL#INSERT]] statements, within the inserted values
* In [[SQL#SELECT]] statements, within the table or column name
* In [[SQL#SELECT]] statements, within the [[SQL#ORDER BY]] clause

## Second-order SQL injection
In second-order SQL injection (stored SQL injection), the application takes user input from an [[HTTP]] request and stores it for future use. This is usually done by placing the input into a database, but no vulnerability arises at the point where the data is stored. Later when handling a different [[HTTP]] request the application retrieves the stored data and incorporates it into a SQL query in an unsafe.
