## Example
Consider the following example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'foo' AND password = 'bar'
```
An attacker can simply remove the password check by injecting an [[SQL#Comments]].
He can than input any username and log in as that user.
Example attack
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' --' AND password = 'bar'
```
