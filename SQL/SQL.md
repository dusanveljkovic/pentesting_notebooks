VALUES (value1, value2);
```

### UNION
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements.
* Every `SELECT` statementt within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
* The columns must also have similar data types
* The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order
```sql
SELECT columns_names FROM table1
UNION
SELECT columns_names FROM table2;
```

### ORDER BY
