### SELECT
The `SELECT` statement is used to select data from a database.
```sql
SELECT column1, columns2, ...
FROM table_name;
```
### UNION
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements.
* Every `SELECT` statementt within `UNION` must have the same number of columns
* The columns must also have similar data types
* The columns in every `SELECT` statement must also be in the same order
```sql
SELECT columns_names FROM table1
UNION
SELECT columns_names FROM table2;
```
### ORDER BY
The `ORDER BY` statement is used to sort the fetched data in either ascending or descending order.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column(s) ASC|DESC
```
**Column numbers can also be used instead of column names**
### NULL
A field with a `NULL` values is a field with no value.
### CASE

```SQL
CASE
	WHEN cond1 THEN result1
	WHEN cond2 THEN result2
	WHEN condN THEN resultN
	ELSE result
END;
```
