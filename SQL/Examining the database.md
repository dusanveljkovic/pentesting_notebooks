## Querying the database type and version
Different databases provide different ways of querying their version.
The queries to determine the database version for some popular database types:
| Database type | Query |
|--|---|
|Microsoft, MySQL|`SELECT @@version`|
|Oracle|`SELECT * FROM v$version`|
|PostgreSQL|`SELECT version()`|
## Listing the contents of the database
Most database types (excluding Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema which provide information about the database
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
```
You can then query `information_schema.columns` to get the columns of a table
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='Users'
```
### Oracle information schema
On Oracle you can obtain the same information with slightly different queries
```sql
SELECT * FROM all_tables
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name='USERS'
```
