# Directory traversal
Directory traversal is a web security vulnerability that allows and attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application.

## Reading arbitrary files bia directory traversal
```html
<img src="/loadImage?filename=218.png">
```
This html code read a file located at `/var/www/images` named `218.png`

An attacker can submit the following request to the server
```
https://insecure-website.com/loadImage?filename=../../../../etc/passwd
```

This causes the application to read the following path
`/var/www/images/../../../../etc/passwd`

## Common obstacles to exploiting file path traversal vulnerabilites
* You might be able to use absolute path `/etc/passwd` to directly reference a file without using any traversal sequenec
* You might be able to use nested traversal sequences `....//` or `....\/`
* You can encode the `../` characters resulting in `%2e%2e%2f` or `..%c0%af` or `..%ef%bc%8f`
* When an application requires that user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as `/var/www/images`, then it might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences `/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`
* When an application requires that user-supplied filename must end with an expected file extension such as `.png` then it might be possible to use a null byte `%00` to terminate the file path before the required extension `filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png`
