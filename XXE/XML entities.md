## What is XML ?
XML is a language designed for storing and transporting data. XML  does not use predefined tags, and so tags can be given names that describe the data.

## What are XML entities ?
XML entities are a way of representing an item of data within an XML document intead of using the data itself.

## What is document type definition ?
DTD containts declarations that can define the structrue of an XML document, the types of data values it can contain, and other items. The DTD is declared within the optional `DOCTYPE` element at the start of the XML document

## What are XML custom entities ?
```xml
<! DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY myentity "my entity value" > ]>
```
Reference `&myentity` will be replaced with the defined value `my entity value`

## What are XML external entites ?
XML external entites are a type of custom entity whose definiction is located outside of the DTD where they are declared

The declaration of an external entity used the `SYSTEM` keywword and must specify a URL from which the value of the entity whould be
```xml
<! DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY ext SYSTEM "http://normal-website.com" > ]>
```
```xml
<! DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY ext SYSTEM "file:///path/to/file" > ]>
```

XML external entites provide the primary means by which [[XXE injection]] arises.
