## Keeping users logged in
This functionality is often implemented by generating a 'remember me' token of some kind which is then stored in a persistent [[Cookies]]. As possessing the cookie effectively allows you to bypass the entire login process it is best practice for this cookie to be impractical to guess.
Some websites have predictable cookie which can be exploited by deducing how they are made and forging our own.
Even with proper ecvryption with a one-way hash function is not completely bulletproof. If the attacker is able to easily identify the hashing algorithm and no salt is used they can potentially brute-force the cookie by simply hashing their wordlist.

## Resetting user passwords
### Resetting passwords using a URL
Less secure implementations of this method use a URL with an easily guessable parameter to identify which account is being reset
```txt
http://vulnerable-website.com/reset-password?user=victim-user
```

A better implementation of this process is to generate a high-entropy, hard-to-guess token and create the reset URL based on that.
```txt
http://vulnerable-website.com/reset-password?token=a0ba0d1cb3b63d13822572fcff1a241895d893f659164d4cc550b421ebdd48a8
```

However some websites fail to also validate the token again when the reset form is submitted. In this case an attacker could simply visit the reset form from their own account, delete the token, and leverage this page to reset an arbitrary user's password.

If the URL is generated dynamically, this may also be vulnerable to [[Password reset poisoning]]. 

## Changing user passwords
Password change functionality can be particulary dangerous if it allows an attacker to access it directly without being logged in as the victim user. This can potentially be exploited to enumerate usernames and brute-force passwords.
