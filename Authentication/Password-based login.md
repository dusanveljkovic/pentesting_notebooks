## Brute-force attacks
A brute-force attack is when an attacker uses a system of trial and error in an attempt to guess valid user credentials.

### Brute-forcing usernames
Usernames are especially easy to guess if htey conform to a recognizable pattern, such as an email address. For example it is very common to see busniess logins in the format `firstname.lastname@somecompany.com`.

### Brute-forcing passwords
Passwords can similarly be brute-forced, with the difficulty varying based on the strength of the password. Many websites adopt some form of password policy, which forces users to create high-entropy passwords that are, theoretically at least harder to crack using brute-force alone.
Rather than creating a strong password with random combination of characters, users ofhten take a password taht htey can remember and try to crowbar it into fitting the password policy. For example if `mypassword` is not allowed users may try something like `Mypassword1!`

### Username enumeration
While attempting to brute-force a login page, you should pay particular attention to any differences in:
* [[HTTP#Codes]] 
* **Error messages**
* **Response times**: For example, a website might only check whether the passwword is correct if the username is valid. This extra step might cause a slight increase in the seponse time.

## Flawed brute-force protection
Brute-force protection revolves around trying to make it as tricky as possible to automate the process and slow down the rate at which an attacker can attempt logins. Two most common ways are:
* Locking the account that makes too many failed login attempts
* Block the remote user's IP if they make too many login attempts in quick succession

You might find that your IP is blocked if you fail to log in too many times. In some implementations, the counter for the number of failed atttempts resets if the IP owner logs in successfully. This means an attacker would simply have to log in to their own account every few attempts to prevent this limit from ever being reached

### Account locking
Locking an account offers a certain amount of protection against targeted brute-force of a specific account. However this approach fails to adequately prevent brute-force attacks in which the attacker is just trying to gain access to any random account they can.

The following method can be used to work around this kind of protection:
1. Establish a list of candidate usernames that are likely to be valid
2. Decide on a very small shortlist of passwords that you think at least one user is likely to have
3. Try each of the candidate usernames with each password

### User rate limiting
Making too many login requests within a short period of time causes your IP address to be blocked.
There are several ways an attacker can manipulate their apparent IP in order to bypass the block.

As the limit is based on the rate of [[HTTP]] requests sent from the users IP address it is sometimes also possible to bypass this defense if you can work out how to guess multiple passwords with a single request.
