# OS Command Injection
OS command injection is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server that is running an application, and typically fully compomise the application and all its data.

## Useful commands
| Purpose of command   | Linux       | Windows       |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Name of current user | whoami      | whoami        |
| Operating system     | uname -a    | ver           |
| Network config       | ifconfig    | ipconfig /all |
| Network connections  | netstat -an | netstat -an   |
| Running processes    | ps -ef      | tasklist      |
