# Reflected XSS
Reflected XSS arises when an application receives data in an HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe way.

## Fingind and testing for reflected XSS vulnerabilites
* **Test every entry point**
* **Submit random alphanumeric values** - for each entry point submit a unique random value and determine whether the value is reflected in the response.
* **Determine the reflection context** - [[XSS Contexts]]
* **Test a candidate payload**
* **Test alternative payloads**
* **Test the attack in a browser**
