# Content Security Policy
CSP is a browser security mechanism that tries to mitigate [[XSS]] attacks. It works by restricting the resource that a page can laod as well as restricting whether a page can be framed by other pages

## Mitigating XSS using CSP
The following directive allow scripts to be loaded only from the same origin source:
```html
script-src 'self'
```

The following directive allows scripts to be loaded from a specific doamin:
```html
script src https://normal-website.com
```

If there is any way for an attacker to control content that is served from the external domain, then they might be able to deliver an attack

Many CSPs disallow scripts but allow imgs.This can be used to disclose [[CSRF]] tokens.

## Mitigating dangling markup attacks using CSP
```html
img-src 'self'

img-src https://normal-website.com
```

This will not prevent other attacks like injecting an acnhor tag with a dangling href attribute

## Bypassing CSP with policy injection
Websites may reflect input into the CSP. With this we can add a semicolon and add our own domains.
