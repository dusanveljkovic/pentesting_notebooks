# Payloads for XSS attacks
## Virtual Defacement
This attack involves injecting malicious data into a page of web application to feed misleading information to users of the application.

## Injecting Trojan Functionality
This attack injects actual working functionality into the vulnerable application. The itent is to deceive end users into performing some undesirable action, such as entering sensitive data that is then transmitted to the attacker.

## Inducing User Actions
If an attacker hijacks a victim's session, he can use the application 'as' the user and carry out any action on the user's behalf. This approach is not always desirable. Attacker must carry out the relevant action on behalf of every users. This also leaves traces in application logs.

An alternative to session hijacking is to use the attack payload script to perform the actions. This attack payload is particulary usefulin cases where an attacker wawnts to perform some action that requires adminstrative privileges.

## Exploiting Any Trust Relationships
If the application employs forms with autocomplete enabled JavaScript issued by the application can capture any previously entered data that the user's browser has stored in the autocomplete cache.

# Delivery Mechanisms for XSS Attacks
## Delivering Reflected and DOM-Based XSS Attacks
* In a targeted attack, a forged e-mail may be sentt to a single target user or a small number of users.
* A URL can be fed to a target user in an instant message.
* Content and code on third-party websites can be used to generate requests that trigger XSS flaws.
