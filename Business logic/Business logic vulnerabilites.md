## Escessive trust in client-side controls
A fundamentally flawed assumption is that users will only interact with the application via the provided web interfacec. An attacker can simply use [[Burp Proxy]] to tamper with the data after it has been sent by the browser but before it is passed into the server-side logic.

## Failing to handle unconventional input
When auditing applications you should try input in ranges that legitimate users are unlikely to ever enter. This includes exceptionally high or exceptionally low numeric inputs and abnormally long strings for text-based fields. You can even try unexpected data types.

## Trusted users won't always remain trustworthy
Application may appear to be secure because they implemented roubst measures to enforce the business rules. Unfortunately, some applications make the mistake of assuming that having passed these strict controls initially the user nad their data can be trusted indefinitely.

## Users won't always supply mandatory input
When probing for logic flaws, you should try removing each parameter in turn and observing what effect this has on the response. You should make sure to:
* Only remove one parameter at a time to ensure all relevant code paths are reached
* Try deleting the name of the parameter as well as the value.
* Follow multi-stage processes through to completion. Sometimes tampering with a parameter in one step will have an effect on another step further along in workflow
