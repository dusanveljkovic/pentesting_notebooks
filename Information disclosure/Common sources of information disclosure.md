This kind of vulnerabilites are commonly [[Access control vulnerabilites]] and [[IDOR]].

## Source code disclosure via backup files
Once an attacker has access to the source code, this can be a huge step towards being able to identify and exploit additional vulnerabilites that would otherwise be almost impossible. One such example is [[Insecure deserialization]].

## Information disclosure due to insecure configuration
Comparing the diff will allow you to read small snippets of code. As with any source code you might also find sensitive data hard-coded within some of the changed lines.
